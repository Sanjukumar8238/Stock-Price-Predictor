## Future Work

- We can further combine this data with that of stock sentiment data in order to achieve even better conclusion
- Also we can possibly use Clustering algorithsm to develop a buy/sell recommendation system

## Conclusion

- We can clearly see in the accuracy chart that the accuracy of the algorithms - "2", "6", "8" and "10" are the highest.
- But when we see the rmse chart we find that the algorithms "2" and "8" is unusually high.
- So we conclude that the algorithms "6" and "10" i.e. AdaBoostRegressor and LSTM(Long Short term Memory) have performed very well both in terms of accuracy and rmse.
